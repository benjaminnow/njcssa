                The Tech House is a mutual goal between Newark Kids Code and the New Jersey Computer Science Student 
                Alliance. The Tech House is a project run by Darrin Sharif, whose goal is to provide a 24/7 learning space 
                for Newark students in technical areas. The NJCSSA will help to make Tech House a success by providing 
                classes through our instructors and curriculum once it is up and running.  We will also help to promote 
                fundraising efforts for the Tech House.
