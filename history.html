            <h3>TLDR:</h3>
            <p>
                The New Jersey Computer Science Student Alliance was founded in August 2018 by Ben Campbell. 
                The idea of the NJCSSA came after Ben had completed teaching a month long Python coding course for 
                Newark Middle Schoolers at Link Charter Academy.  Ben decided to hold the Python coding class because 
                he was interested in teaching computer science. His AP computer science teacher was a big inspiration. 
                Additionally, a program at Rutgers called the Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Science 
                inspired Ben. The NJCSSA and USACS have a lot in common. Both are focused on helping students learn 
                computer science through peer to peer mentoring. The slight difference between the two organizations 
                is that USACS is run by college students and is only for Rutgers students. The NJCSSA, as of May 2019, 
                is focused solely on high school students.

                In May 2019 the NJCSSA became a 501c3 non-profit. You can read the blog post about the process [here].

            <h3>Long Version:</h3>
            <p>        
                Ben Campbell started an organization to teach underprivileged high school students in Newark New Jersey. 
                He have partnered with community members in Newark to host physical classes in Newark 3 days a week, 8 hours 
                per week, and 10 weeks in total. The first class for the pilot program started on January 28th.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ben comes from a privileged background where he had access to classes like AP Computer Science and 
                passionate teachers to help him out. Around his area, there are affluent towns with kids like himself who 
                have taken advantage of opportunities to learn computer science. After teaching a month long Python class 
                in Newark in the summer of 2018, he decided that teaching Python could be a school year program if he could 
                get volunteers to help out. He got inspiration for the NJCSSA partly from the Undergraduate Student Alliance 
                of Computer Science at Rutgers University. USACS is very similar to the NJCSSA because it focuses on peer to 
                peer mentoring in Computer Science.

                In September of 2018 he started the NJCSSA by drafting a website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages: njcssa.org. 
                For 3 months he emailed and called CS teachers from local high schools asking them to promote my program. Out 
                of 20 emails, he only got 1 response. He changed his tactics and instead started to email guidance counselors. 
                Why? Because they need to get kids to college. Volunteering in something like NJCSSA would look great on college 
                applications. This time, he had a much greater response rate with about 10 guidance counselors getting back to him.

                <br>
                What makes the NJCSSA stand out is his philosophy(probably others have it too) on "learning how to learn" and 
                being a self-taught developer. While a student in Newark doesn't have the opportunities he has, they can still become 
                a great programmer with a desire, a device, and an internet connection. Ben learned this philosophy when he taught himself 
                how to build a fully-fledged website using Python Flask. He didn't know anything before starting and he didn't have a 
                teacher. He just had a desire and the wealth of resources available to me on the internet. The NJCSSA teaches kids how 
                to learn by teaching them the basics in the first half of the course and then letting them loose on the Python Turtle API. 
                This is a simple API, but it teaches the fundamentals of being a self taught programmer.

                For the Python Coding pilot program, he was able to recruit 15 high school volunteers. He made a rough curriculum of the 
                10 weeks, made slideshows, and made practice problems. Several instructors helped out with creating some practice problems. 
                The practice problems can be found on [github].

                <br>
                In May of 2019 the NJCSSA was able to be incorporated as an official 501c3 non-profit. This status will allow the NJCSSA to 
                take donations and make those donations tax deductible to donors. You can read more about the process [here].
                <br>
                <br>
                The NJCSSA plans to hold a month-long summer class in July 2019. Stay tuned for more details.
