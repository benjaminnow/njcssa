<h1>History</h1>
<p>
    The New Jersey Computer Science Student Alliance was founded in August 2018 by Ben Campbell. The idea of the NJCSSA
    came after Ben had completed teaching a month long Python coding course for Newark Middle Schoolers at Link Charter
    Academy. Ben decided to hold the Python coding class because he was interested in teaching computer science. His AP
    computer science teacher was a big inspiration. Additionally, a program at Rutgers called the Undergraduate Student
    Alliance of Computer Science inspired Ben in the eventual creation of the NJCSSA. The NJCSSA and USACS have a lot in
    common. Both are focused on helping students learn computer science through peer to peer mentoring. The slight
    differences are that USACS is run by college students. The NJCSSA, as of May 2019, is focused solely on high school
    students.

    In May 2019 the NJCSSA became a 501c3 non-profit. You can read the blog post about the process [here].
