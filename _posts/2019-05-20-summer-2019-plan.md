Based on that successful pilot program, the NJCSSA will be running another program for the summer. This time the class is scheduled for 4 weeks, 5 days per week for 3 hours a day, beginning either July 1st or July 8th. I’m also thinking about changing the curriculum slightly to accomodate a shorter schedule. I was thinking about doing Snap! Programming for the first 2-3 weeks and then moving onto Python. If you don’t know what Snap is, it’s a programming language designed at UC Berkeley that is based off of Scratch. It provides some more advanced blocks than Scratch which will be helpful for the students to transition to Python.
