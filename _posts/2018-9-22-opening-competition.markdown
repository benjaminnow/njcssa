To celebrate the opening of NJCSSA and its partnership with Newark Kids Code, we are holding a programming competition for students to compete to win a 2008 Macbook Pro.
The Macbook Pro functions perfectly, but it also needs a new battery because it's 10 years old. This problem can be solved by either leaving the Macbook plugged in at all times or by buying a replacement battery. [Replacements can be found for under $30.](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=macbook+pro+15+late+2008+battery&_sop=12)

The competition's rules:
* work must be done by the student alone - students can use the internet, books, and other students for help.
* copy and pasting of code is allowed, but don't make your whole project 90% pasted
* **student projects need to have a purpose in the community**
    * example projects:
        * website for a church
        * mobile app for non-profit
* how work is submitted:
    * on github.com and sending the link to **ben.njcssa@gmail.com**
    * sharing the zipped code with **ben.njcssa@gmail.com** on google drive
* **Due Date: Dec 1st**
