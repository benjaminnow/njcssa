            <h3>Do instructors make money?</h3>
            <p>Not right now. We may have funds to pay instructors once we get funding from large corporations. Before this, we have to prove that NJCSSA is a success on a small scale with limited funding.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How will teaching work?</h3>
            <p>At NJCSSA we value teaching kids how to do tasks on their own. That is why we promote the "Google/StackOverflow Strategy". This means that the kid should 
                Google the question, come up with probable solutions, implement them, and if they are truly stuck come to an instructor. This philosophy creates students
                who are self-sufficient.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What are the instructors there for then?</h3>
            <p>Instructors may teach mini lessons on certain topics. Examples may be an intro to pygame, intro to JS, intro to Scratch. They will then let the kids go off on
                their own to create a project using the introduction from the topic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instructors are the backup if Google is not coming up with a good answer.(very rare) They can also provide help in design decisions, offer helpful online resources, and provide
                1 on 1 tutoring to struggling students.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is the curriculum?</h3>
            <p>There is no strict curriculum. Students are encouraged to pursue whatever they want whether that is game development, app development, web development, or something completely different. 
                There are always ways in which those concepts can be taught at an introductory level. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, a student may want to make a game and they don't have any programming experience. We might start them out on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle">Python's turtle game</a> to get them thinking about drawing graphics.
                Once they have mastered the turtle, they may move onto <a href="https://www.pygame.org/tags/all">Pygame</a>. Then when they are proficient, they can move onto things like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal Engine</a>. We believe in progressive challenges in learning.
