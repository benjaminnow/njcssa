            <h3>What sets the NJCSSA apart from other coding programs?</h3>
            <p>
                <ol style="font-size: 16px">
                    <li><b>Length of class</b> - We run much longer programs than many other coding initiatives.
                    Our shortest program is 4 weeks, with our longest being 10 weeks. We usually have around 4 classes
                    a week, for a total of 6-8 hours of instruction/week.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Target demographic</b> - While many programs choose to focus on middle school and elementary school
                    students, the NJCSSA has chosen to target high school students and talented middle school students. Computer science is a 
                    complicated topic, and we believe that a higher level of maturity is needed to grasp the most important concepts.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Instructors</b> - We have chosen to use high school computer science students as instructors. Many of them
                    have already taken or are currently in the process of taking AP Computer Science at their high school.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Low student/instructor ratios</b> - The NJCSSA has been fortunate to receive a lot of support from high school
                    volunteers. In our classes, there are usually 3-4 students per instructor. This low ratio allows for personalized
                    tutoring sessions where learning is greatly accelerated.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Do instructors make money?</h3>
            <p>Not right now. We may have funds to pay instructors once we get funding from large corporations. 
                Before this, we have to prove that NJCSSA is a success on a small scale with limited funding.
                For those who are curious, the founder does not make money from this organization either.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How will teaching work?</h3>
            <ul>
                Structured Curriculum
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Several instructors will teach the kids the basics of Python, JS, or another language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The structured classes will be held several times a week and will consist of lectures 
                        and lab/problem solving sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The kids will move through a structured curriculum to gain the skills necessary to 
                        become <u>independent</u> learners.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Instructors who are not ready for leading "front of class" instruction will act as support teachers for 
                    kids who have questions during the lessons. They will also support any students who have moved on to the 
                    unstructured curriculum.
                </p>
                <br>
                Unstructured Curriculum
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After mastering the basics, the students move on to the unstructured curriculum which 
                        consists of lab/problem solving sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the NJCSSA we value teaching kids how to solve problems on their own. The future of 
                        learning is self-learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That is why we promote the "Google/StackOverflow Strategy". This means that the student 
                        should Google the question, come up with probable solutions, implement them, and, if 
                        they are truly stuck, come to an instructor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This philosophy creates students who are self-sufficient and empowered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>What is an example of unstructured learning?</h3>
            <p>
                For example, a student may want to make a game but may not have all of the programming 
                experience, beyond what we gave them in the structured curriculum, to be successful. We 
                might start them out on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle">Python's turtle game</a> 
                to get them thinking about drawing graphics in the most basic sense.
                Once they have mastered the turtle game, they may move on to 
                <a href="https://www.pygame.org/tags/all">Pygame</a>. Then when they are proficient, 
                they may independently move on to things like <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal Engine</a>, 
                which are two powerful game engines many modern games are programmed with. We believe in 
                progressive challenges in learning and providing students with the skills to independently 
                meet their challenges.

            <h3>How much experience is needed for instructors?</h3>
            <p>
                The NJCSSA requires instructors to have a basic knowledge of programming. There are different 
                roles for instructors: the more experienced will be lead teaching while the less 
                experienced will be in a support role. The kids will likely have little programming 
                experience and will appreciate any help you can provide. Volunteering with the NJCSSA will 
                also be an opportunity for less knowledgeable instructors to improve their skills. If 
                you still have any questions email Ben.
