            <h3>Newark Kids Code</h3>
            <p>
                Newark Kids Code is a coding outreach program in Newark focused on middle schoolers. Their model is using Honors 
                College students from The New Jersey Institute of Technology to teach their classes of middle schoolers. Darrin Sharif 
                is the director and founder of Newark Kids Code. He works on fundraising and promotion. He is partnered with professor 
                Michael Lee at NJIT, and Dr. Lee crafts the curriculum and teacher selection process. Honors College Students who are 
                instructors are paid using a National Science Foundation grant that Dr. Lee received.

                Newark Kids Code and Mr. Sharif in particular have been vital to the success of the NJCSSA. Mr. Sharif was helpful in 
                providing contacts in Newark to Ben so that he could get his program started. Mr. Sharif, also being on the leadership 
                team at the Urban League of Essex County, was able to provide the NJCSSA with teaching space and equipment for the NJCSSA’s 
                inaugural coding class in the Spring of 2019.

                Newark Kids Code is focused on Middle School students, and together, the NJCSSA and NKC can create a pipeline for skilled 
                technical talent in Newark.

            <h3>The Electronic Access Foundation & Laptop Upcycle</h3>
            <p>
                The Electronic Access Foundation and Laptop Upcycle are both charity organizations which give grants of refurbished laptops 
                to deserving projects. Ben was lucky to get their support for running his Python coding class for middle schoolers in July of 2018. 
                They provided 6 refurbished MacBook Pros for the students who graduated the class. Many of the students didn’t have their own device 
                at home for school work or programming, so they were all delighted to receive laptops that they could own. The NJCSSA is grateful to 
                have them as partners and will continue to use their support for technical hardware outreach.
