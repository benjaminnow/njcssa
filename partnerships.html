            <h3>The Electronic Access Foundation & Laptop Upcycle</h3>
            <p>
                The Electronic Access Foundation and Laptop Upcycle are both charity organizations that donate refurbished laptops 
                for charitable projects. Ben was fortunate to get their support for running his Python coding class for middle 
                school students in July 2018. They provided 6 refurbished MacBook Pros for the students who graduated from that 
                class. Many of the students did not have their own devices at home for school work or programming, so they were all 
                very excited to receive laptops that they could keep at the end of the class. The NJCSSA is grateful to have these 
                organizations as partners.
